# HandmadeExpo: The Ultimate Marketplace for Handcrafted Treasures

## A Mobile Platform Where Artisans and Buyers Connect, Chat, and Bargain in Real-Time

---

## 📖 What is HandmadeExpo?

**HandmadeExpo** is an Android mobile application designed to bridge the gap between talented artisans who create handmade products and buyers who appreciate unique, handcrafted items. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms, HandmadeExpo introduces a **real-time bargaining system** that allows buyers to negotiate prices directly with sellers through an integrated chat feature.

Built as a school project using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**, HandmadeExpo demonstrates a complete marketplace ecosystem with three user roles: **Buyers**, **Sellers**, and **Administrators**. The app enables sellers to list their handmade products, buyers to browse and make price offers, and admins to manage the entire platform through a dedicated panel.

**Key Highlights:**
- 🛒 Browse and purchase unique handmade products
- 💬 Real-time chat between buyers and sellers
- 💰 Unique bargaining system for price negotiation
- 📊 Admin panel for platform management
- 🔔 Notifications for offers and messages
